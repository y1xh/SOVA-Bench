Overproduction and underconsumption of goods also contributed to the economic downturn. Additionally, the Fed's tight monetary policy and the lack of government regulation of the economy exacerbated the situation.",
        "reference": "The Great Depression was a period of economic decline that lasted from 1929-1939, making it the longest-lasting depression in modern history. It affected not only the United States but countries around the world, causing substantial social and economic upheaval.\n\nThere were several major causes of the Great Depression, which include:\n\n1. Stock Market Crash of 1929 - In October of 1929, the stock market experienced a significant fall that wiped out millions of investors. This event is considered by many to be the initial trigger of the Great Depression.\n\n2. Overproduction - During the 1920s, many industries produced more goods than consumers wanted or could afford. This ultimately led to a decline in demand for goods, causing job loss, lower wages, and business failure.\n\n3. High Tariffs and War Debts - Protectionist trade policies in the form of high tariffs led to a decline in global trade, as other countries retaliated with tariffs of their own. Additionally, many countries were struggling to repay war debts, which led to economic instability.\n\n4. Bank Failures - As demand for goods declined, many banks began to fail, causing a loss of confidence in the banking system. This led to a massive withdrawal of money from banks, causing even more banks to fail.\n\n5. Drought Conditions - The Dust Bowl was a severe drought and dust storm that hit the Great Plains region of the United States in the 1930s. This had a significant impact on agriculture, causing many farmers to lose their land and livelihoods which worsened the effects of the depression.\n\nOverall, the Great Depression was caused by a combination of factors, including economic, environmental, and political factors. Its impact was widespread, affecting millions of people around the world."

        "reference": "Word embeddings are a type of natural language processing technique used to map words or phrases from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers. The idea is to represent words in a continuous vector space, where the similarity between words can be measured by the distance between their corresponding vectors. This can be done using algorithms such as Word2Vec or GloVe, among others.\n\nThe use of word embeddings has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing, as it allows computers to understand text in a much more meaningful way than simply looking at the presence or absence of individual words. For example, when using word embeddings, the computer can understand that the words \"dog\" and \"puppy\" are closely related, while the words \"dog\" and \"umbrella\" are not.\n\nWord embeddings are used in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and many others.
