I need your assistance in evaluating the performance of several models. Each model receives a user input, which it needs to understand and generate a sentence to answer the question. During this evaluation phase, a suggested reference answer is provided for each question.

Your task is to evaluate whether the model's answer ([Prediction]) for each question ([Question]) aligns with the reference answer ([Reference]). If the answer is inconsistent with the reference but still correctly addresses the question, it should also be considered correct.

Following are the predictions and corresponding reference answers:

**[Question]: {question}

**[Prediction]: {prediction}

**[Reference]: {reference}

Respond with "Y" for correct and "N" for incorrect answers only.
